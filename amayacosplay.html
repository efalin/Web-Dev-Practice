		<h1>Amaya Cosplay</h1>

		<p> Amaya is a character from the Netflix show The Dragon Prince, and she was a big challenge to make! Still, I'm glad I stuck with it, and ended up with a result that I am proud of. </p>

		<p> Amaya's outfit included a ton of armor, as well as a huge sword and shield. I patterned all of these things myself, and then made them out of simple EVA foam. I especially loved how the shield turned out! It's so big and pretty, and the gold line details turned out really nice. If you're interested in making your own shield, you can check out this <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/770105399/general-amayas-shield-digital-templates?ref=shop_home_feat_1/">digital pattern</a> I made for it.</p>
		
		<p> So much of this cosplay - including the metal armor, leather parts, and weapons - was made out of cheap and simple EVA foam! A little while ago I created an <a href="https://skl.sh/337IrGd">online video course</a> to teach people all about how to make their own armor out of foam. You should really check it out!</p>
		
		<p>The total cost for this cosplay ended up being around $270, though it could have been much lower had I planned better, and bought exactly the amount of supplies I would need; I had a lot of excess material afterwards that I was able to use for future cosplays.</p>
